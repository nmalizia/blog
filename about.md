Hello.

I'm a Data Scientist with [The Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/). I live and work in the Boston area. I'm passionate about family, friends and food. Oh, and data and maps are pretty cool too.

You can find out more about me via my [homepage](http://nmalizia.github.io/) and [resume](http://nmalizia.github.io/resume/).
