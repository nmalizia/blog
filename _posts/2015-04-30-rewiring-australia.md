title: Rewiring Australia's Future
---

BCG.com's recruiting section updated to highlight the firm's role in helping Australia plan the roll out of their next generation of broadband infrastructure. [See here for the feature](http://www.bcg.com/careers/work/impact-stories/rewiring-australia.aspx). In collaboration with their National Broadband Network, our teams helped save the country AU$30 billion and shaved 4 years off their timeline. There is a section where I am interviewed on the role that spatial analysis played in the case. It was one of the more intense cases I've been on, but well worth the efforts.
