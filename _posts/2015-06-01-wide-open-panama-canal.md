title: How the Panama Canal is Redrawing the Logistics Map
---

[A BCG Perspectives article was released that explores the impact of widening the Panama Canal on traffic and volume at US ports](https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/transportation-travel-tourism-how-panama-canal-expansion-is-redrawing-logistics/). I built and operated the model of the global container flows that was used for the simulation modeling in this report. It was essentially a variant of a multi-commodity network flow mode. Great to see this article finally published and [get picked up by news outlets like the Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/east-coast-ports-could-see-a-substantial-traffic-boost-from-panama-canal-expansion-report-1434603601).
