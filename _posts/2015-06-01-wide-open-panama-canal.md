title: Impact of the Panama Canal Expansion on US Ports
---

A recent BCG Perspectives article entitled ["Wide Open: How the Panama Canal Expansion is Redrawing the Logistics Map"](https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/transportation-travel-tourism-how-panama-canal-expansion-is-redrawing-logistics/) explores the impact of the widening of the Panama Canal on traffic and container volume at US ports. I built and operated the model of the global container flows that was used for the simulation modeling in this report. It was essentially a variant of the [multi-commodity network flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem). Great to see this article finally published and [get picked up by news outlets like the Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/east-coast-ports-could-see-a-substantial-traffic-boost-from-panama-canal-expansion-report-1434603601).
