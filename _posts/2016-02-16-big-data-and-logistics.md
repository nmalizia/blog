title: Big Data and Logistics
---

As a result of working a spate of recent very data-rich logistics cases, a team from BCG compiled learnings into a recently released article titled ["Leveraging Big Data to Manage Logistics"](https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/supply-chain-management-leveraging-big-data-manage-logistics/). Given my involvement in a number of these cases I was invited to contribute. The article focuses on five main levers that can help optimize routes and reduce costs: mode and route mix, warehouse and distribution center network, production origin and destination swaps, shipment consolidation, and shipping rates. See the article for more details.
